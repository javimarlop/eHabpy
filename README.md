**eHabitat** GRASS GIS and Python scripts for automatic delineation of habitats within protected areas and calculation of maps of probabilities to find areas presenting similar ecological characteristics to those found in protected areas within the corresponding ecoregion. A habitat replaceability index (HRI) is also computed based on the ratio between the extent of similar areas around the park and the park extent. Processed results are being updated and can be accessed through the [DOPA Explorer](http://ehabitat-wps.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dopa_explorer/).
